= Demo for sending Confluent Platform logs to ELK

This playground for experimenting with migrating Kafka from Zookeeper to KRaft.
It features an optional ELK (Elastic, Kibana, fleet agent) stack for easier observability.

Please change to one of these two sub folders and continue with the README there:

* `apache-kafka` (link:./apache-kafka/README.adoc[README])
* `confluent-platform` (link:./confluent-platform/README.adoc[README])
