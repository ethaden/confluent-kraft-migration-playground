= Demo for sending Confluent Platform logs to ELK

This playground for experimenting with migrating Kafka from Zookeeper to KRaft.
It features an optional ELK (Elastic, Kibana, fleet agent) stack for easier observability.

DISCLAIMER: This project is for demonstration purposes only. Using the demo unmodified in production is highly discouraged. Use at your own risk.

## Confluent Platform vs. Apache Kafka
Please change to one of these two sub folders and continue with the README there:

* `apache-kafka` (link:./apache-kafka/README.adoc[README])
* `confluent-platform` (link:./confluent-platform/README.adoc[README])
